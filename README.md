# Explore Hacker News Posts
## Exploring Hacker News Posts for the most engaging hour to make a post 

In this project, we'll work with a dataset of submissions to popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

Exploring this dataset, we are specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`.

Users submit `Ask HN` posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question

Likewise, users submit `Show HN` posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting

`Our goal` is to compare these two types of posts to determine the following:
* Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?
* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
